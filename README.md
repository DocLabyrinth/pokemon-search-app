# Pokemon Search App

This is a very basic app I put together for an interview coding task. Since there was only very
limited time for development, it uses the Expo library and only react components without a data
store. It could definitely be optimised a lot further, but for now it should function on Android
and iOS.

It works by making requests to the [Pok√©mon TCG API]](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/)

The fastest way to get the app running is to install the Expo app from the app store and
start the app by scanning the QR code at this link:

### Setup

yarn install

### Running the app locally

yarn start
